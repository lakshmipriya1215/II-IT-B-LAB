AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:
To convert unsorted array in to sorted array by using insertion sorting.

DESCRIPTION:

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large arrays.Insertion sort algorithm picks
elements one by one and places it to the right position where it belongs in the sorted list of elements.

STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:

1. First we have declare the array size.

2. Then we have to check whether the array is sorted or not, if it is sorted then it prints the array to the output.

3. If the array is not sorted it goes to the insertion sort function.

4. Here the first element in the array is assumed as sorted.

5. Take the second element and store it to the temporary variable.

6. Now the first two elements are sorted. Take the third element and compare it with the elements on the left of it and insert at the correct position.

7. This process continues until the total array gets sorted.

OUTPUT OBTAINED:

OUTPUT 1:
1. First scan the size of array and the elements of the array.

2. Take array as {12,45,32,78,65,90,67,2,0,3}, the array is not sorted so it goes to the insertion sort function and prints the sorted array to the output.

OUTPUT 2:
1. First scan the size of array and the elements of the array.

2. Take array as {34,56,90,-35,-89,0}, the array is not sorted so it goes to the insertion sort function and prints the sorted array to the output.
